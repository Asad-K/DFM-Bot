## About The Project
This is a Bot for [drfrostmaths.com](drfrostmaths.com). 
It was originally based of [AK163631's Answer Tool](https://github.com/AK163631/DFM-Answer-Tool)

## Getting Started
### Setup
1. Download the latest version from [Releases](https://github.com/Jacrac04/DFM-Bot/releases)
2. Run the .exe
3. Enter your login details - Ensure that your [Dr frost account](https://www.drfrostmaths.com/account.php) is not linked to google or another service.
4. Enter a question url.
    - This should look like `https://www.drfrostmaths.com/do-question.php?aaid=12345678`
    - make sure that there is nothing else like `qnum=5` in it.

### Tips
* If you use a 'keep going till i say' question url the only way to stop the bot is by closing the window or terminating the process
